# MCA CT 104 - Software Engineering and Object Oriented Modeling

This course introduces the principles of software engineering, covering the software development lifecycle, process models, requirements analysis, design, testing, and fundamental concepts of UML modeling.

---
## Course Objectives

* To Familiarize students with the need and importance of **software engineering**.
* To impart basic insights to students about various activities in different phases of software engineering.
* To provide knowledge in **modeling tools** (UML).

## Course Contents

### Module 1: Introduction and Process Models
* **Introduction to Software Engineering:** Definition and characteristics of software, Broad categories of computer software, Software Myths.
* **The Software process:** Software engineering layers, A process framework (five generic process framework and umbrella activities), Software product and software process.
* **Process Models:** Waterfall model, Evolutionary models (Prototyping and Spiral models).
* **Agile view of process:** Agile process, Human factors, Agile Process models (Extreme programming and Scrum).

### Module 2: Requirements Engineering and Analysis
* **Requirements engineering:** Tasks, Initializing process, Types of requirements, Feasibility studies.
* **Eliciting requirements:** Interviews, brain storming, FAST, QFD, Use case approach.
* **Requirement Analysis:** Steps, DFD, Data Dictionary, ER diagrams, prototyping.
* **Requirement documentation and review:** Nature of SRS, Characteristics of good SRS, Organization of an SRS (IEEE standard format basics only), the requirements review process.

### Module 3: Software Design
* **Software Design:** Conceptual and technical design, design objectives, importance of design.
* **Modularity:** Module coupling, module cohesion, relationship between coupling and cohesion.
* **Strategy of design:** Function oriented design, Object oriented design (steps to analyze and design object oriented systems).

### Module 4: Software Testing
* **Software Testing:** Strategic approach (verification and validation), criteria for completion of testing.
* **Test strategies for conventional software:** Unit testing, integration testing (Regression testing, smoke testing), validation testing, system testing (recovery, security, stress, performance).
* **Testing Tactics:** **Black box** (equivalence partitioning), **White box** (Basis path testing, flow graph notation, deriving test cases).

### Module 5: Object Oriented Modeling
* **Use Case:** Actors Scenarios & Use cases, drawing Use Case Diagrams, system sequence diagram.
* **UML Interaction Diagrams:** Sequence and communication diagrams (notation and comparison).
* **Class Diagrams:** Introduction, common class diagram notation.
* **Activity Diagrams and Modeling:** Introduction, example, basic activity diagram notation.
