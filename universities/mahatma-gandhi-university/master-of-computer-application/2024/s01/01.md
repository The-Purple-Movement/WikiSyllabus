## Course Objectives

* To explain the underlying concepts and tools in **Discrete Mathematics** with emphasis on their applications to Computer Science.
* To familiarize the students with the scope and applications of **Statistical theory** in Computer Applications.
* To impart insights about the concepts of **Probability**, Tests of significance, and Tests of the hypothesis as the basis of Inferential Statistics.
