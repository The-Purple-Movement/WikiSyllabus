# CST281: Object Oriented Programming (Minor)

## Course Objectives

- Write Java programs using the object-oriented concepts â€” classes, objects, constructors, data hiding, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
- Utilise datatypes, operators, control statements, built-in packages & interfaces, Input/Output Streams, and Files in Java to develop programs.  
- Illustrate how robust programs can be written in Java using the exception handling mechanism.  
- Write application programs in Java using multithreading.  
- Write GUI-based application programs using event handling features and Swing in Java.
