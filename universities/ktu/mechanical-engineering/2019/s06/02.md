# MET304: Dynamics and Design of Machinery

## Course Objectives
* Do engine force analysis and draw turning moment diagrams.  
* Analyse free and forced vibrations of single degree of freedom systems.  
* Determine the natural frequencies of a two degree of freedom vibrating system and calculate the stresses in a structural member due to combined loading.  
* Design machine elements subjected to fatigue loading and riveted joints.  
* Design welded joint and close coiled helical compression spring.  

## Course Content
### Module - 1 (Dynamic Force Analysis and Flywheels)
* Dynamic force analysis – D’Alembert’s principle – four bar mechanism – engine force analysis (reciprocating engines) – piston side thrust – connecting rod force – piston effort – dynamic force analysis considering mass of the connecting rod – analytical method.  
* Flywheels – turning moment diagrams for four stroke internal combustion engine and multi cylinder engines – coefficient of fluctuation of speed – coefficient of fluctuation of energy – design of flywheels.  

### Module - 2 (Vibrations of Single Degree of Freedom Systems)
* Introduction – free vibration of single degree undamped systems – natural frequency – energy method – Newton’s second law (free body diagram).  
* Damped systems – logarithmic decrement.  
* Forced vibration – single degree of freedom systems – harmonic excitation – vibration isolation – transmissibility – whirling of shafts.  

### Module - 3 (Two Degree of Freedom Systems and Introduction to Design)
* Introduction to two degree of freedom systems – natural frequencies and mode shapes.  
* Introduction to design – definition, steps in the design process, materials and their properties – elastic and plastic behaviour of metals, ductile and brittle behaviour, shear, bending and torsional stresses, combined stresses, stress concentration factor.  

### Module - 4 (Fatigue and Riveted Joints)
* Shock and impact loads – fatigue loading – Gerber, Goodman and Soderberg criteria – endurance limit stress – factors affecting endurance limit – factor of safety.  
* Design of riveted joints – material for rivets – modes of failure – efficiency of joint – design of boiler and tank joints – structural joints.  

### Module - 5 (Welded Joints and Springs)
* Design of welded joints – welding symbols – stresses in fillet and butt welds – butt joint in tension – fillet weld in tension – fillet joint under torsion – fillet weld under bending – eccentrically loaded welds.  
* Springs – classification – spring materials – stresses and deflection of helical springs – axial loading – curvature effect – resilience – static and fatigue loading – surge in spring – critical frequency – concentric springs – end construction.
