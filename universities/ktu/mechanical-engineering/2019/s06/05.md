# MET312: Non Destructive Testing

## Course Objectives

* To provide basic knowledge of surface NDT to carry out various inspections in accordance with established procedures.  
* To enable students to differentiate various defect types and select the appropriate NDT methods for the specimen.  
* To train students to calibrate instruments and evaluate components for imperfections.  
* To impart fundamental understanding of ultrasonic testing for inspection of samples.  
* To provide theoretical and practical understanding of radiographic testing, interpretation, and evaluation.
