# MAT202: Probability, Statistics and Numerical Methods

## Course Objectives

* introduce the modern theory of probability and statistics, covering important models of random variables and techniques of parameter estimation and hypothesis testing  
* familiarise students with numerical techniques for finding roots of equations, evaluating definite integrals, solving systems of linear equations, and solving ordinary differential equations, especially when analytical solutions are difficult to obtain  

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Discrete Probability Distributions)

* discrete random variables and their probability distributions  
* expectation, mean and variance  
* binomial distribution, poisson distribution, poisson approximation to the binomial distribution  
* discrete bivariate distributions, marginal distributions  
* independent random variables  
* expectation – multiple random variables  

### Module - 2 (Continuous Probability Distributions)

* continuous random variables and their probability distributions  
* expectation, mean and variance  
* uniform, exponential and normal distributions  
* continuous bivariate distributions, marginal distributions  
* independent random variables  
* expectation – multiple random variables  
* i.i.d random variables and central limit theorem (without proof)  

### Module - 3 (Statistical Inference)

* population and samples  
* sampling distribution of the mean and proportion (for large samples only)  
* confidence interval for single mean and single proportion (for large samples only)  
* test of hypotheses: large sample test for single mean and single proportion, equality of means and equality of proportions of two populations  
* small sample t-tests for single mean of normal population  
* equality of means (pooled t-test, for independent samples from two normal populations with equal variance)  

### Module - 4 (Numerical Methods - I)

* errors in numerical computation – round-off, truncation and relative error  
* solution of equations – newton-raphson method and regula-falsi method  
* interpolation – finite differences, newton’s forward and backward difference method, newton’s divided difference method, lagrange’s method  
* numerical integration – trapezoidal rule and simpson’s 1/3rd rule (proof or derivation not required)  

### Module - 5 (Numerical Methods - II)

* solution of linear systems – gauss-siedal and jacobi iteration methods  
* curve fitting – method of least squares, fitting straight lines and parabolas  
* solution of ordinary differential equations – euler and classical runge-kutta method of second and fourth order  
* adams-moulton predictor-corrector method (proof or derivation not required)
