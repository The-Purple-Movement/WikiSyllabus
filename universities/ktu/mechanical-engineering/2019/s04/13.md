# MET292: Continuum Mechanics

## Course Objectives

* Provide a comprehensive, systematic and integrated knowledge of the principles of continuum mechanics  
* Familiarize students with physical laws and analytical tools such as tensor calculus required to formulate and solve continuum problems  
* Develop understanding of the common principles underlying solid mechanics and fluid mechanics
