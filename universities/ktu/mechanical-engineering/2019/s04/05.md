# EST200: Design and Engineering

## Course Objectives

* introduce the fundamental principles of design engineering  
* understand the steps involved in the design process  
* familiarize with basic tools and approaches in design  
* apply design thinking in learning and practicing engineering  
* consider factors such as customer requirements, economics, reliability, life cycle issues, aesthetics, ergonomics, sustainability, and professional ethics in designs  

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Basic Concepts in Design Engineering)

* engineering design vs. other kinds of design  
* stages in the design process  
* design thinking â€“ concepts and approaches  
* prototyping and proofing in engineering design  
* concepts: modular design, life cycle design, value engineering, concurrent engineering, reverse engineering  
* design rights  

### Module - 2 (Design Thinking and Application)

* iterative process for design thinking in developing products (e.g., pen, umbrella, bag)  
* divergent and convergent thinking in generating and narrowing down alternative designs  
* problem-based learning in creating design solutions  
* role of ethics in engineering design  

### Module - 3 (Innovative and Sustainable Design)

* development of simple products through stages of the design process  
* graphical design communication: 2D and 3D drawings for simple products  
* developing new designs through bio-mimicry
