# MET204: Manufacturing Process

## Course Objectives

* Gain theoretical and practical knowledge in material casting processes and understand the dependent and independent variables which control materials casting in a production process  
* Provide detailed discussion on the welding process and the physics of welding, introduce different welding processes, weld testing, and advanced processes to appreciate practical applications of welding  
* Learn methods of analysis allowing a mathematical/physical description of forming processes  
* Correlate the material type with possible fabrication processes  
* Generate solutions to problems that may arise in manufacturing engineering
