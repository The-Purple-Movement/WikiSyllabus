# MET282: Theory of Machines

## Course Objectives

* expose the students to the fundamentals of kinematics of mechanisms, design of cams, theory and analysis of gears, gear trains, clutches, and brakes  
* provide knowledge on velocity and acceleration analysis of different mechanisms  
* develop understanding of balancing of rotating and reciprocating masses  
* introduce the concepts of gyroscopes and energy fluctuation in machines  

## Course Content

### Module - 1

* kinematics - links, mechanism, degrees of freedom, grashoff's law  
* four-bar chain, slider crank chain - inversions and practical applications  
* velocity and acceleration diagrams of simple mechanisms  
* coriolis acceleration (theory only)  
* friction clutch - pressure and wear theories, pivot and collar friction, single and multiple disc clutches  

### Module - 2

* gear – classification of gears, gear terminology, law of gearing  
* gear trains - simple, compound gear trains, epicyclic gear trains  
* brakes - block and band brakes, self-energizing and self-locking in braking  

### Module - 3

* cams - types of cams  
* cam profiles for knife edged and roller followers with and without offsets for shm, constant acceleration-deceleration, and constant velocity  

### Module - 4

* static and dynamic balancing of rotating mass - single and several masses in different planes  
* balancing of reciprocating mass  
* gyroscope – gyroscopic torque, gyroscopic stabilization of ships and aeroplanes  

### Module - 5

* governors - types of governors, simple watt governor, porter governor, theory of proell governor, isochronism, hunting, sensitivity and stability  
* flywheel - turning moment diagrams, fluctuation of energy
