# MET294: Advanced Mechanics of Fluids

## Course Objectives

* apply conservation equations of fluid mechanics  
* use potential flow theory in fluid problems  
* utilize approximate solutions of the navier-stokes equations  
* compute effect on boundary layers  
* explain turbulence and turbulence modelling  

## Course Content
