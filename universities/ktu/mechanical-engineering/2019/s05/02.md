# MET301: Mechanics of Machinery

## Course Objectives

* Introduce the fundamentals of the kinematics of various mechanisms and their displacement, velocity, and acceleration analysis  
* Cover the design of cams, theory and analysis of gears, gear trains, and synthesis of mechanisms  
* Perform static force analysis of planar mechanisms and study the concept and effects of gyroscopic couples  
* Estimate unbalance in rotating and reciprocating masses and suggest methods to overcome it
