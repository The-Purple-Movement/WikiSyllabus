# MET393: Experimental Stress Analysis

## Course Objectives

* Impart the basic aspects of theory of elasticity and stress-strain relationship  
* Introduce experimental stress analysis techniques such as photo elasticity, strain gauges, and non-destructive testing (NDT) methods  

## Course Outcomes

* CO1 Analyse stresses, strains, and deformations under 2D and 3D loading using tensorial and graphical (Mohrâ€™s circle) approaches  
* CO2 Describe instruments used for strain measurement based on stress-strain relationships  
* CO3 Explain concepts behind measurement and instrumentation  
* CO4 Describe the concepts behind photo elasticity and brittle coating  
* CO5 Describe various NDT methods for strength evaluation
