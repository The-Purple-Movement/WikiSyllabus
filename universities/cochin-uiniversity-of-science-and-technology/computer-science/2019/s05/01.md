# 19-501-0101: COMPILER DESIGN

## Course Objectives
1. Understand the phases of compilation and their roles.
2. Explore lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis.
3. Learn code generation and optimization techniques.
4. Study error handling and symbol table management.
5. Understand the design of modern compiler architectures.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Explain the different phases of a compiler and their functions.
* **CO 2:** Implement lexical and syntax analyzers for a subset of programming languages.
* **CO 3:** Construct parse trees and handle semantic checks.
* **CO 4:** Design simple intermediate code generators and apply optimizations.
* **CO 5:** Understand runtime environments and memory management in compilers.

## Course Content

### Module - I Introduction to Compilation
* Structure of compiler, phases of compilation, compiler construction tools.
* Lexical analysis: tokens, patterns, lexemes, finite automata, regular expressions, lexical errors.

### Module - II Syntax Analysis
* Context-free grammars, derivations, parse trees, ambiguity, recursive descent parsing.
* LL(1), LR(0), SLR(1) parsing techniques, shift-reduce conflicts, parser error recovery.

### Module - III Semantic Analysis
* Syntax-directed translation, attribute grammars, symbol tables, type checking.
* Intermediate representations — syntax trees, DAG, three-address code.

### Module - IV Code Generation
* Storage organization, activation records, runtime environments.
* Code generation issues, target machine architecture, register allocation.

### Module - V Code Optimization
* Machine-independent optimizations, loop optimizations, peephole optimizations.
* Machine-dependent optimizations, introduction to Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
