# 19-401-0102: DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

## Course Objectives
1. Introduce the fundamentals of database systems.
2. Understand ER modeling and relational model concepts.
3. Learn SQL, normalization, and schema design.
4. Study transaction management and concurrency control.
5. Explore database recovery and security mechanisms.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Explain the architecture and data models of DBMS.
* **CO 2:** Design ER models and relational schemas.
* **CO 3:** Develop SQL queries for data manipulation.
* **CO 4:** Apply normalization techniques and handle transactions.
* **CO 5:** Demonstrate knowledge of concurrency, recovery, and database security.
