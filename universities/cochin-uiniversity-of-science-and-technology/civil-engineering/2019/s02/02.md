# 19-101-0202: STRUCTURAL MECHANICS

## Course Objectives
1. To introduce analysis of statically determinate structures.
2. To understand bending, shear, and axial stresses.
3. To apply mechanics to beam, truss, and frame problems.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Analyze forces in trusses and frames.
* **CO 2:** Compute shear force and bending moments in beams.
* **CO 3:** Evaluate axial, bending, and combined stresses.
* **CO 4:** Design simple structural members.
* **CO 5:** Relate theory to practical civil engineering structures.
