# CSE1001: DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

## Course Objectives
1. Introduce fundamental data structures and algorithms used in computer science.
2. Develop ability to design, analyse and implement efficient algorithms.
3. Explore applications of data structures in solving computational problems.
4. Enable understanding of complexity and trade-offs in algorithmic design.
5. Prepare students for advanced programming, systems and software courses.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Identify and apply suitable data structures for a given problem.
* **CO 2:** Implement linear and non-linear data structures efficiently.
* **CO 3:** Analyse time and space complexity of algorithms.
