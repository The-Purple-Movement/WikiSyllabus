# 23MAT216: PROBABILITY AND RANDOM PROCESSES

## Course Objectives
1. Introduce probability theory and its applications in engineering.
2. Familiarize students with random variables, distributions, and stochastic processes.
3. Enable modeling of uncertainties and statistical estimation.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Compute probabilities and solve related problems.
* **CO 2:** Analyze discrete and continuous random variables.
* **CO 3:** Apply stochastic process concepts in real-world scenarios.
