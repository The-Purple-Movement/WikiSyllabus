# CSE1005: OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING USING C++

## Course Objectives
1. Introduce the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).  
2. Develop modular, reusable and maintainable software using C++.  
3. Demonstrate inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation concepts.  
4. Enhance problem-solving skills through OOP-based design.  
5. Familiarize students with file handling and templates in C++.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Understand the structure and syntax of C++ programs.  
* **CO 2:** Apply OOP concepts like classes, inheritance and polymorphism.  
* **CO 3:** Develop programs using operator/function overloading.  
* **CO 4:** Use templates and exception handling in applications.  
* **CO 5:** Design small-scale projects with modular and reusable code.

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction to C++
* Evolution of C++ and OOP principles.  
* Classes, objects, constructors, destructors.

### Module 2: Functions and Overloading
* Function overloading, inline functions, friend functions.  
* Operator overloading.

### Module 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism
* Types of inheritance: single, multiple, multilevel, hybrid.  
* Virtual functions, abstract classes, runtime polymorphism.

### Module 4: Templates and Exception Handling
* Function and class templates.  
* Exception handling mechanism using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`.

### Module 5: File Handling
* Input/output streams, file read/write operations.  
* Binary files and error handling.

### Module 6: Project Work
* Mini projects demonstrating OOP design.  
* Example: Student management system, Library management, etc.
