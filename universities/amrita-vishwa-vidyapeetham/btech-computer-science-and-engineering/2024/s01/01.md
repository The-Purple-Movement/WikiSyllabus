# CSE1001: PROGRAMMING IN C

## Course Objectives
1. Introduce the fundamentals of computer programming.
2. Develop problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.
3. Familiarize students with C language syntax and structure.
4. Enable modular and reusable program design.
5. Provide practical experience in coding, compiling, and debugging.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Understand the structure and syntax of C programming language.
* **CO 2:** Write, compile, and debug basic C programs.
* **CO 3:** Apply control structures, arrays, functions, and pointers to solve problems.
* **CO 4:** Design modular programs using user-defined functions and structures.
* **CO 5:** Analyze real-world problems and implement solutions using C.

### ✅ Notes
- You can replace course details (code, title, modules) with any **actual Amrita syllabus** if you have the official one.  
- The `contributor` should be your GitHub handle (`@iamkarthik2004`).  
- Once added, it will render just like the CUSAT example you showed.
