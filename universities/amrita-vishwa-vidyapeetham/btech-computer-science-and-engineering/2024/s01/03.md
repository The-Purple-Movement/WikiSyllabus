# CSE1003: INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AND PROGRAMMING

## Course Objectives
1. Introduce basic concepts of computer science and programming.  
2. Familiarize students with computational thinking and problem-solving.  
3. Learn a high-level language (e.g., Python or C) for programming.  
4. Develop simple algorithms and implement them.  
5. Understand how software interacts with hardware.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Explain fundamental computer science concepts and programming paradigms.  
* **CO 2:** Write, test and debug simple programs to solve problems.  
* **CO 3:** Use control structures, data types and functions effectively.  
* **CO 4:** Apply algorithmic thinking for simple real-world tasks.  
* **CO 5:** Recognize the relationship between software, hardware and data.

## Course Content

### Module 1: Basics of Computer Science
* History of computing, types of computers, software vs hardware.  
* Introduction to binary, data representation.

### Module 2: Programming Fundamentals
* Variables, data types, operators, input/output.  
* Control statements: if-else, loops.

### Module 3: Functions and Modular Programming
* Modular program design, parameter passing, return values.  
* Recursion basics.

### Module 4: Data Structures Basics
* Arrays, lists, strings.  
* Basic searching and sorting (linear search, bubble sort).

### Module 5: Practical Projects
* Mini-project: sample programs that solve real-world tasks (e.g., simple game or data handler).  
* Code documentation and version control basics.
