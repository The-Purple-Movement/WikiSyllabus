# 24CSE301: DATA STRUCTURES

## Course Objectives
1. Understand fundamental data structures and their real-world applications.  
2. Implement data structures using C/C++.  
3. Analyze the performance of operations on data structures.  
4. Apply appropriate data structures for solving computational problems.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Demonstrate understanding of abstract data types and their implementations.  
* **CO2:** Apply linear data structures for problem-solving.  
* **CO3:** Implement and analyze non-linear structures like trees and graphs.  
* **CO4:** Choose optimal data structures for specific applications.
