## Course Objectives
This course introduces students to some basic mathematical ideas and tools which are at the core of the MCA course.  
It introduces the concepts of set theory, relations, functions, and calculus.

---

## Course Outcomes
After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO1:** Apply the operations of sets and use Venn diagrams to solve applied problems; solve problems using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.  
- **CO2:** Describe binary relations between two sets; check their properties and combine relations using set operations and composition.  
- **CO3:** Explain the concept and check the properties of functions which correspond to input-output combinations in computer science.  
- **CO4:** Understand the concept of differentiation as a rate of change and evaluate the derivative of simple functions.  
- **CO5:** Compute the indefinite and definite integrals of standard functions.
