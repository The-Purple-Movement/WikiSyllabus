## Course Objective
This course introduces students to some basic problem-solving ideas and tools which are at the core of the MCA course. It introduces the concepts of algorithm, flow chart, and problem-solving methods.

## Course Outcomes
- **CO 1:** Understand computer system fundamentals.  
- **CO 2:** Develop basic understanding of the concept of algorithm and algorithmic thinking.  
- **CO 3:** Write algorithms and draw flowcharts for solving problems.  
- **CO 4:** Develop the ability to analyse a problem and develop an algorithm to solve it.  
- **CO 5:** Apply the concept of algorithm and flowchart to translating algorithms to flowchart programs.
