# 20INMCA301 NUMERICAL METHODS

**Course Description:**  
This course provides an introduction to the basic concepts and techniques of matrices and its operations, numerical solution of linear and non-linear equations, curve fitting, numerical integration, and differentiation.

## Course Outcomes

After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO1:** Identify special types of matrices and perform elementary row operations of a matrix.  
- **CO2:** Apply the concept of rank of the matrix to solve systems of linear equations.  
- **CO3:** Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix numerically.  
- **CO4:** Apply the concept of curve fitting to fit the best curve using experimental observations.  
- **CO5:** Describe interpolation and approximations.
