### **Module 2**
**The Need for Security:** Business needs – protecting functionality, enabling safe operations, protecting data, safeguarding technology assets.  
**Threats and Attacks:** Threats – compromises to intellectual property, deliberate software attacks, espionage, trespass, sabotage, vandalism. Attacks – malicious codes, backdoors, denial of service (DoS/DDoS), spoofing, sniffing, spam, social engineering, theft.

### **Module 3**
**Risk Management:** Definition, risk identification, risk assessment, risk control.  
**Information Technology in Today’s World:** Protecting personal computers, challenges, attacks, security measures, securing mobile and portable systems, cloud computing deployment, security and privacy issues, trust and risk.

### **Module 4**
**Security Technology:** Access control, password security, firewalls, protecting remote connections, intrusion detection and prevention systems, honeypots, honeynets, padded cell systems, scanning and analysis tools.  
**Cryptography:** Cipher methods, cryptographic algorithms, cryptographic tools, public key infrastructure (PKI), digital signatures, digital certificates, protocols for secure communications (S-HTTP, S/MIME, SET, SSH, WPA, IPSec, PGP).

### **Module 5**
**Physical Security, Implementation, and Maintenance:** Physical access controls, interception of data, implementing information security (project management, technical aspects, non-technical aspects), information systems security certification and accreditation.
