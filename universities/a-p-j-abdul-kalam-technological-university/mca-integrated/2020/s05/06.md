# 20INMCA331 RDBMS LAB

**Course Description:**  
The syllabus is prepared to enable MCA graduates to write SQL and PL/SQL to solve computational problems in their professional life. Students will explore various data manipulations and cover essential RDBMS fundamentals. Students are expected to come prepared with programs written in rough record for lab classes.

## Course Outcomes

After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO1:** Understand, appreciate, and effectively explain the underlying concepts of database technologies.  
- **CO2:** Design and implement a database schema for a given problem-domain.  
- **CO3:** Apply different normalization techniques.  
- **CO4:** Populate and query a database using SQL DML/DDL commands.  
- **CO5:** Use any popular RDBMS for data access and updating.

## SYLLABUS

### **Module 1 (Table Design & DDL Commands – 12 hrs)**

- Table design using foreign key and normalization.  
- Practice SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) commands:  
  - Table creation and alteration (primary key, referential integrity, check, unique, null constraints).  
  - Other database objects: view, index, cluster, sequence, synonym, etc.

### **Module 2 (DML Commands – 12 hrs)**

- Practice SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands:  
  - Row insertion, deletion, updating.  
  - Retrieval of data:  
    - Simple `SELECT` queries.  
    - `SELECT` with `WHERE` options (relational and logical operators).  
    - Functions: numeric, date, character, conversion, group functions with `HAVING` clause.  
    - Set operators.  
    - Sorting data.  
    - Subqueries (single row, multiple rows, more than one column, correlated subqueries).  
    - Joining tables (single join, self-join, outer join).

### **Module 3 (Transaction Control – 6 hrs)**

- Practice Transaction Control Language (TCL) commands: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `COMMIT`, `SAVEPOINT`.

### **Module 4 (PL/SQL Constructs – 6 hrs)**

- Usage of triggers, functions, and procedures using PL/SQL constructs.

### **Module 5 (Sample Applications & Backup – 12 hrs)**

- Development of sample applications using Oracle as backend. Examples:  
  - Payroll Information System  
  - Student Information System  
  - Bank Transaction  
  - Library Information System  
- Backup and restore using Oracle.
