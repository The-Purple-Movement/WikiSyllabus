## Course Outcomes

After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO1:** Summarize and exemplify fundamental nature and characteristics of database systems.  
- **CO2:** Conceptualize data using the relational model and describe relational database concepts.  
- **CO3:** Develop queries for relational databases in practical applications.  
- **CO4:** Model and design relational databases following design principles.  
- **CO5:** Solve database problems using SQL and PLSQL.
