# 20INMCA309 INTRODUCTION TO OPERATIONS RESEARCH

**Course Description:**  
Operations Research (OR) is an analytical method of problem-solving and decision-making. Topics include Linear Programming, Transportation and Assignment problems, Game Theory, and Queuing Models.

## Course Outcomes

After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO1:** Model and solve decision-making problems using Linear Programming techniques.  
- **CO2:** Solve linear programming problems using artificial variables and duality.  
- **CO3:** Apply concepts of transportation and assignment problems to solve practical problems.  
- **CO4:** Use Game Theory to solve real-world problems.  
- **CO5:** Understand and extend queuing models to analyze real-world systems.
