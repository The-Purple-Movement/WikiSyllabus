# 20INMCA204 Statistical Applications

This course introduces the concepts and applications of correlation, regression and testing of hypothesis. The topics treated in this course have applications in Computer Science.

## Course Outcomes
After the completion of the course the student will be able to:
- **CO1:** Analyse practical problems using the principles of correlation.  
- **CO2:** Analyse practical problems using the principles of regression.  
- **CO3:** Estimate sample parameters using different methods.  
- **CO4:** Explain the concept of statistical inference.  
- **CO5:** Evaluate parameters for small samples.
