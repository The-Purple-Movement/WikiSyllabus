## Course Description
This lab course is designed to help MCA students gain hands-on experience in writing C programs for solving computational problems they may encounter in professional settings.  
Students will explore programming constructs, develop algorithms, and implement structured programming solutions.  
Prior preparation with rough records is expected before each lab session.

## Course Outcomes
After completing this course, the students will be able to:

- **CO1:** Analyse computational problems and develop algorithms or flowcharts to solve them.  
- **CO2:** Apply fundamental concepts of input/output operations, operators, expressions, and control statements.  
- **CO3:** Implement structured programming techniques using various constructs.  
- **CO4:** Illustrate the use of various data types through demonstration programs.  
- **CO5:** Implement lab experiments in both Linux and Windows environments.  
- **CO6:** Identify the use of structures and files in program development.
