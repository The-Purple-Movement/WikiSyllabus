## Course Outcomes

After the completion of the course, the students will be able to:

- **CO1:** Recognize and apply the concepts needed to test the logic of a program using propositions.  
- **CO2:** Apply the principle of mathematical induction and pigeonhole principle to solve problems.  
- **CO3:** Explain number theory and apply it to ensure secure communication.  
- **CO4:** Use a combination of theoretical knowledge and independent mathematical thinking in creative evaluation of questions in graph theory.  
- **CO5:** Analyse the properties of trees and implement tree algorithms.
