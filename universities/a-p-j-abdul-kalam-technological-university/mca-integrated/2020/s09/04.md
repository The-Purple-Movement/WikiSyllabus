# 20INMCA531 - Data Science Lab

This course helps students gain practical experience in programming tools for data sciences and big data tools. This lab is designed to introduce implementation of practical machine learning algorithms.

## Course Outcomes
After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO 1:** Practice the concepts of data collection and wrangling  
- **CO 2:** Apply EDA techniques for data pre-processing  
- **CO 3:** Integrate data visualisation in big-data analytics  
- **CO 4:** Apply mathematical and statistical functions for practicing data science  
- **CO 5:** Apply basic machine learning algorithms
