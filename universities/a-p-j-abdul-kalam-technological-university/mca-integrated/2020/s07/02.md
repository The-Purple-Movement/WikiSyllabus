# 20INMCA403 - Java Programming

The syllabus is prepared with the view of preparing the MCA Graduates capable of writing readable JAVA programs to solve computational problems that they may have to solve in their professional life. The course content covers essential object-oriented programming fundamentals.

## Course Outcomes
After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:
- **CO 1:** Understand the concepts of object-oriented programming paradigms and develop skills in these paradigms using Java  
- **CO 2:** Apply the concepts of strings, arrays and inheritance  
- **CO 3:** Analyse and evaluate the use of interfaces, create Java application programs using sound OOP practices and proper program structuring  
- **CO 4:** Apply and understand JAVA I/O operations and Web applications using Applets  
- **CO 5:** Apply the concepts of Event Handling and provide an exposure to advanced applications such as TCP and UDP network programming
