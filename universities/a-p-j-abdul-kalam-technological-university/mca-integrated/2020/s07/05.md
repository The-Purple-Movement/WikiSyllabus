# 20INMCA409 - Distributed Computing

**Course Overview:**  
This course provides a solid theoretical foundation, giving students insight into sophisticated distributed computing systems and large data processing facilities that provide significant computing capabilities.

**Course Outcomes:**  
- **CO 1:** Recognize distributed systems architecture.  
- **CO 2:** Distinguish between various communication models in distributed systems.  
- **CO 3:** Examine various consistency models.  
- **CO 4:** Examine different cloud models and services.  
- **CO 5:** Understand and analyse different virtualization mechanisms.

**Syllabus:**

**Module 1: Introduction to Distributed Systems**  
- Definition, goals, types (Distributed Computing Systems, Distributed Information Systems, Distributed Pervasive Systems).  
- Processes Virtualization, Clients, Servers (General Design Issues, General Organization, Distributed Servers).  
- Code Migration (Approaches to Code Migration, Migration and Local Resources).

**Module 2: Communication and Synchronization**  
- RPC: Basic RPC operation, conventional procedure call, client and server stubs, parameter passing (value parameters, asynchronous RPC).  
- Synchronization: Clock synchronization (Physical Clocks, GPS), Election Algorithms (Bully, Ring), Mutual Exclusion (Centralized, Distributed, Token Ring).

**Module 3: Consistency, Replication, and Fault Tolerance**  
- Data-centric consistency, client-centric consistency.  
- Fault tolerance: process resilience, reliable client-server communication, reliable group communication (basic reliable multicasting schemes, atomic multicast, virtual synchrony).

**Module 4: Technologies for Network-Based Systems**  
- System Models for Distributed and Cloud Computing – NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture.  
- Cloud Models and Services – IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, Public vs Private Cloud.

**Module 5: Virtualization and Cloud Architecture**  
- Virtual machines and virtualization of clusters and data centers: Implementation levels, structures/tools, CPU, memory, and I/O virtualization.  
- Architectural design of compute and storage clouds: Layered cloud architecture, design challenges.
