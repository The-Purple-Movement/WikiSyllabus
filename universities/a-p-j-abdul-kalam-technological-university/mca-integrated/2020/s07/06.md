# 20INMCA431 - Java Programming Lab

**Course Overview:**  
This course prepares MCA graduates to write Java programs to solve computational problems and explore programming constructs and data structures for basic problem solving in Java.

**Course Outcomes:**  
- **CO 1:** Understand the concepts of object-oriented programming paradigms and develop skills in Java.  
- **CO 2:** Apply the concepts of constructors and destructors.  
- **CO 3:** Implement various inheritance concepts.  
- **CO 4:** Analyse and evaluate the use of interfaces, exception handling, and multithreaded programming.  
- **CO 5:** Apply and understand JAVA I/O operations, Applets, and event handling concepts.

**Syllabus:**  

**Classes:** Class fundamentals, declaring objects, constructors, access control (public, private, protected).  

**Inheritance:** Member access and inheritance, using `super` and `this` keywords, method overriding, dynamic method dispatch, abstract classes, `final` inheritance.  

**Packages:** Defining a package, importing packages.  

**Interface:** Defining an interface, implementing an interface.  

**Multithreaded Programming:** Creating threads by extending `Thread` and implementing `Runnable`, creating multiple threads.  

**I/O:** Byte streams, character streams, reading console inputs, reading characters, reading strings.  

**Applets:** Applet basics, passing parameters to applets.  

**Event Handling:** Event listener interface, AWT classes, working with graphics, working with color.  

**Networking:** TCP/IP client sockets, TCP/IP server sockets, datagrams.
