# 20INMCA432 - Advanced DBMS Lab

This course provides understanding of relational and non-relational database systems and their design. It covers SQL, PL/SQL, and NoSQL programs essential for web-based application development and deployment. It also serves as a prerequisite for advanced courses in Data Science.

## Course Outcomes
After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO 1:** Design and build a simple relational database system and demonstrate competence with fundamental tasks of modeling, designing, and implementing a database.  
- **CO 2:** Apply PL/SQL for processing databases.  
- **CO 3:** Understand the basics of relational and non-relational (NoSQL) databases and configure NoSQL databases.  
- **CO 4:** Apply CRUD operations and retrieve data in a NoSQL environment.  
- **CO 5:** Understand the basic storage architecture of distributed file systems.  
- **CO 6:** Design and deploy NoSQL databases for real-time requirements.
