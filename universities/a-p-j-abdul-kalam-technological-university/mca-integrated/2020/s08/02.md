# 20INMCA404 – Advanced Computer Networks

The syllabus is prepared with the view of equipping the MCA Graduates in the domain of internetworking applications and throughout the networking terminologies. The course content is decided to cover the essentials explored with respect to various protocols within the TCP/IP protocol stack. An introduction to the Python Network programming language is included in this to motivate students for hands-on experiments.

## Course Outcomes
After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO 1** Analyse the terminology and concepts of the OSI reference model and the TCP‐IP reference model.
- **CO 2** Analyse basic taxonomy and terminology of the computer networking area.
- **CO 3** Assess advanced networking concepts of protocols, network interfaces, and design/performance issues in LAN and WAN.
- **CO 4** Evaluate various related technical, administrative, and social aspects of specific computer network protocols related to error detection and control.
- **CO 5** Gain expertise in specific areas of networking such as the design of networking applications using Python.
