# 20INMCA402 - Advanced Database Management Systems

This course provides the basic concepts and terminology related to relational and non-relational database management systems. The concept of advanced DBMS techniques and new generation databases like MongoDB, HBase, and Cassandra are also introduced. This course serves as a prerequisite for many advanced courses in Data Science and Machine Learning areas.

## Course Outcomes
After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO 1:** Understand the fundamentals of relational database systems including: data models, database architectures.
- **CO 2:** Analyze and apply the different normalization techniques.
- **CO 3:** Assess the basic issues of transaction processing and concurrency control.
- **CO 4:** Understand the roles that databases play in organizations and familiarize with basic database storage, file organization, database accessing techniques.
- **CO 5:** Understand the basics of query processing, object-oriented, distributed databases.
- **CO 6:** Analyze non-relational database systems and structures and XML.

## Continuous Internal Evaluation Pattern
- Attendance: 8 marks
- Continuous Assessment Test (2 numbers): 20 marks
- Assignment/Quiz/Course Project: 12 marks

## End Semester Examination Pattern
There will be two parts: Part A and Part B.  
- Part A: 10 compulsory short answer questions, 2 from each module. Each question carries 3 marks.  
- Part B: 2 questions from each module of which the student should answer any one. Each question can have a maximum of 2 sub-divisions and carries 6 marks.
