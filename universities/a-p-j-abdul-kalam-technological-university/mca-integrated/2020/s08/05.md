# 20INMCA434 - Networking & System Administration Lab

This course is designed to equip MCA graduates to design, troubleshoot, model, and evaluate computer networks. Students explore network simulation programs, evaluate network design approaches, and execute network programs using Python under various operating systems.

## Course Outcomes
After completion, the student will be able to:

- **CO1:** Design a computer network and configure relevant protocols.  
- **CO2:** Implement socket programming for client-server interaction.  
- **CO3:** Create a simple Pyro Server, XML-RPC server, and connect to SSH server to execute commands remotely.  
- **CO4:** Perform MD5 checksum on files and remove duplicate files.  
- **CO5:** Experiment with SNMP network discovery, understanding relationships and interdependencies.
