## Course Objectives
This course introduces students to the concept of grouping data together and describing the attributes and actions that can be performed on a particular instance of the data. It provides a foundation for efficient data organization, management, and algorithmic problem-solving.

---

## Course Outcomes
After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO1:** Relate which algorithm or data structure to use in different scenarios.  
- **CO2:** Implement standard algorithms for searching and sorting.  
- **CO3:** Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve problems using linear lists.  
- **CO4:** Implement applications using basic data structures such as arrays, stacks, and queues.  
- **CO5:** Analyze the concepts of trees and graphs and their implementation using basic data structures and algorithms.

## Syllabus

### **Module 1 – Introduction to Data Structures**
Introduction to data structures, concepts, data types, data objects, and Abstract Data Type (ADT) — definition and operations.  
Types of data structures.  
**Algorithm Analysis:** Definition, properties, performance analysis — space complexity, time complexity, and asymptotic notation.

---

### **Module 2 – Arrays, Searching, and Sorting**
**Arrays:** Concept of arrays, operations on arrays, two-dimensional arrays, and row/column major representation.  
**Searching and Sorting Techniques:** Linear search, binary search, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

---

### **Module 3 – Linked Lists**
**Singly Linked List:** Definition, array vs linked list, insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.  
**Circular Linked List:** Insertion, deletion, and traversal.  
**Doubly Linked List:** Insertion, deletion, and traversal.

---

### **Module 4 – Stacks and Queues**
**Stacks:** Definition and concept, operations (push and pop), static and dynamic implementation, and applications such as conversion of infix to postfix expressions and evaluation of postfix expressions.  
**Queues:** Definition and concept, operations (enqueue and dequeue), static and dynamic implementation, circular queue, doubly ended queue (deque), types of deque, and applications (simulation, CPU scheduling, Round Robin algorithm).

---

### **Module 5 – Trees and Graphs**
**Graphs:** Definition, terminologies, graph representations, and traversals — BFS and DFS (informal description and examples).  
**Trees:** Definition and terminology, binary tree, array and linked representation, recursive traversal — preorder, inorder, and postorder (with examples).  
Binary Search Tree (BST) — insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal using recursion.  
**AVL Tree:** Definition and examples.
