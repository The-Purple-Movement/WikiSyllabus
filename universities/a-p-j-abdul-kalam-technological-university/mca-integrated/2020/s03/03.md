## Course Objectives
This course aims to build object-oriented programming skills through programming in **C++**.  
The pioneer programming language to implement object-oriented features is C++.  
Real-world problems can be best solved using an object-oriented approach.  
The course content covers the essential object-oriented programming fundamentals that can be taught within the given curriculum slots.

## Course Outcomes
After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO1:** Understand object-oriented programming fundamentals.  
- **CO2:** Understand dynamic memory management techniques using pointers, constructors, and destructors.  
- **CO3:** Apply the various object-oriented concepts to solve real-life problems.  
- **CO4:** Illustrate how stream classes support input/output operations in C++.  
- **CO5:** Demonstrate advanced programming concepts such as Templates and Exception Handling.
