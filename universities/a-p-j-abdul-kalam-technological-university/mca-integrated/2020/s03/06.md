## Course Outcomes
After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO1:** Assess how the choice of data structures and algorithm design methods impacts program performance.  
- **CO2:** Choose the appropriate data structure and algorithm design method for a specified application.  
- **CO3:** Critically analyze and evaluate various data structures.  
- **CO4:** Solve problems using linear data structures such as stacks and queues.  
- **CO5:** Solve problems using nonlinear data structures.
