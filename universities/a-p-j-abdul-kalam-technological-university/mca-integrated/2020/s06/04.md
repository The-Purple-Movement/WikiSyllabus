# 20INMCA308 DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS

**Course Description:**  
The syllabus is prepared to equip MCA Graduates with techniques for effective problem solving in computing. The course covers the fundamentals of Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

## Course Outcomes

After completion of the course, the student will be able to:

- **CO1:** Implement design principles and analyze the asymptotic performance of algorithms.  
- **CO2:** Derive and solve recurrences describing the performance of divide-and-conquer and greedy algorithms.  
- **CO3:** Synthesize dynamic-programming algorithms and analyze them.  
- **CO4:** Explore algorithm design instances like backtracking and branch & bound for solving analytical problems.  
- **CO5:** Infer basic computational concepts and complexity classes P, NP, and NP-Complete.

## End Semester Examination Pattern

There will be two parts: **Part A** and **Part B**.  
- **Part A:** 10 compulsory short answer questions, 2 from each module, each carrying 3 marks.  
- **Part B:** 2 questions from each module, of which the student should answer any one. Each question can have a maximum of 2 sub-divisions and carry 6 marks.
