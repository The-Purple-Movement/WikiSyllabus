# CST302: Compiler Design

## Course Objectives
* Understand phases of compilation including lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis.
* Learn intermediate code generation, optimization, and final code generation.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Explain each compiler phase and role.
* **CO2:** Construct lexical analyzers and parsers.
* **CO3:** Conduct syntax-directed translation and intermediate code design.
* **CO4:** Analyze runtime environments and error detection techniques.
* **CO5:** Implement code optimization and generation processes.

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction and Lexical Analysis
* Compiler phases overview, lexical scanning, tokenizing techniques.

### Module 2: Syntax Analysis

### Module 3: Semantic Analysis
* Semantic error detection, symbol tables.

### Module 4: Intermediate Code Generation and Optimization
* Three address code, DAGs, peephole optimizations.

### Module 5: Code Generation and Optimization
