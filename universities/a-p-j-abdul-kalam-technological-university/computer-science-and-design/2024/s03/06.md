# PCCSL305: Data Structures Lab

## Course Objectives
* To implement linear and nonlinear data structures and fundamental algorithms in a practical setting.
* To develop programming ability using C/C++/Java and strengthen debugging and documentation.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Implement data structure operations with code[K3].
* **CO2:** Select and justify structures/algorithms for real tasks[K3].
* **CO3:** Analyze time/space complexity experimentally[K4].

## Course Content

* Array, stack, queue implementation
* Linked list (single, double, circular)
* Trees (binary, search, traversal)
* Graph storage, BFS/DFS traversal
* Sorting (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick), searching, and hashing implementation
* Mini-project based on applications of data structures
