# PCCST303: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Course Objectives
* Comprehensive understanding and application of linear and non-linear data structures and algorithms.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Identify proper data structures for problem-solving[K3].
* **CO2:** Implement arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues[K3].
* **CO3:** Implement trees, graphs, traversals[K3].
* **CO4:** Select and implement searching, sorting, and hashing[K3].

## Course Content

### Module 1
* Definitions, abstraction, performance analysis, arrays (polynomials/sparse), stacks/queues, infix-to-postfix, postfix evaluation.

### Module 2
* Linked lists, list operations, stack/queues via linked list, polynomials, doubly/circular linked lists, memory allocation schemes.

### Module 3
* Trees, tree representation, traversals, expression/binary/search trees, heaps, priority queue, graph representations, traversals, graphs.

### Module 4
* Sorting: selection, insertion, quick, merge, heap, radix. Searching: linear, binary. Hashing: functions, collision resolution strategies.
