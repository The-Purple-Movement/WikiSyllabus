# PCCSL307: Digital Systems Lab

## Course Objectives
* To introduce digital logic components and implement basic combinational and sequential circuits.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Analyze digital circuit function and applications[K4].
* **CO2:** Design small-scale digital systems using standard ICs and FPGAs[K3].

## Course Content

* Logic gates, universal gates
* Adders, subtractors, multiplexers, code converters
* Flip-flops, counters, registers, implementation using ICs and simulation
* Simple combinational/sequential circuits design using HDL tools
* Mini-project (e.g., traffic light controller, digital clock)
