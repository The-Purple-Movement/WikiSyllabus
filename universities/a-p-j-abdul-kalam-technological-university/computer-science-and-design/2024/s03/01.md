# GAMAT301: Mathematics for Computer and Information Science-3

## Course Objectives
* Familiarize students with probability and random processes for engineering and science applications.
* Build skills in key probability distributions, stochastic processes, and Markov Chains.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Understand discrete random variables and models and apply them[K3].
* **CO2:** Understand continuous random variables, apply models to phenomena[K3].
* **CO3:** Apply limit theorems, understand characteristics of stochastic processes[K3].
* **CO4:** Solve Markov Chains and predict stochastic processes[K3].

## Course Content

### Module 1
* Random variables, discrete probability distributions, CDF, expectation, binomial and Poisson distributions, joint/marginal pmf, independence.

### Module 2
* Continuous RVs and distributions (uniform, normal, exponential), joint/marginal pdf, independence, expectation for two variables.

### Module 3
* Limit theorems, Markov's/Chebyshev's Inequalities, Law of Large Numbers, CLT (no proof), discrete/continuous stochastic processes, Poisson process.

### Module 4
* Markov Chains, random walk, Chapman-Kolmogorov equations, state classification, irreducibility, recurrence, transience, long-run proportions.
