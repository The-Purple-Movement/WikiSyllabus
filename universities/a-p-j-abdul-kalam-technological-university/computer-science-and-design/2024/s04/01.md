# GAMAT401: Mathematics for Computer and Information Science-4

## Course Objectives
* To provide comprehensive knowledge of graph theory including paths, cycles, trees, coloring and matrix representations with real-world applications.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Understand fundamental graph theory concepts: graphs, vertices, edges, isomorphism, connectedness.
* **CO2:** Understand concepts of Euler and Hamiltonian graphs and connectivity.
* **CO3:** Apply algorithms like Prim's, Kruskal's for MST and Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall for shortest paths.
* **CO4:** Illustrate matrix representations and vertex coloring applications.

## Course Content

### Module 1
* Graph basics: definitions, applications, finite/infinite, incidence and degree, isolated vertex, pendants, null graphs, isomorphism, walk, paths, circuits, connectivity.

### Module 2
* Euler graphs, operations, Hamiltonian paths, TSP, directed graphs, connectivity.

### Module 3
* Trees: properties, rooted/binary trees, spanning trees, Prim and Kruskal algorithms, shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall).

### Module 4
* Matrix representation of graphs: adjacency, incidence, circuit, path matrix, coloring, chromatic number/polynomial, greedy coloring algorithm.
