# GAMAT401: Mathematics for Computer and Information Science-4

## Course Objectives
* To provide thorough understanding of graph theory and algorithmic tools.
* To apply graph theory concepts in computer and information systems design.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Define graphs, walks, paths, circuits and differentiate types of graphs.
* **CO2:** Understand and characterize Eulerian and Hamiltonian graphs.
* **CO3:** Demonstrate tree properties and algorithms for MST, shortest paths.
* **CO4:** Use matrix representations and coloring techniques.

## Course Content

### Module 1
* Graph theory basics: definitions, finite/infinite, connectivity, isomorphism.

### Module 2
* Euler/Hamiltonian paths, directed graphs and connectivity.

### Module 3
* Trees, spanning trees, MST algorithms (Prim/Kruskal), shortest paths (Dijkstra/Floyd).

### Module 4
