# CSL202: Digital Lab

## Course Objectives
* To provide practical exposure to digital circuits and logic system design.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Design and implement basic combinational and sequential logic circuits (Apply).
* **CO2:** Use Verilog/VHDL for modeling digital systems (Apply).
* **CO3:** Debug and document digital experiments (Analyze).

## Course Content

* Experiments with logic gates, combinational circuits (adders, subtractors, multiplexers).
* Sequential circuits (flip-flops, counters, registers).
* Basic hardware description with Verilog/VHDL for digital design.
