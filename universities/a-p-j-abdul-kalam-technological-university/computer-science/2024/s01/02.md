# GAPHT121: PHYSICS FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE

## Course Objectives
1. To equip students with a strong foundation in the fundamentals of Physics, impart this knowledge
within the context of Information Science disciplines, cultivate scientific attitudes and critical
thinking skills, and enable students to integrate Physics concepts with their core Information
Science programs.
2. To make the students gain practical knowledge to correlate the theoretical studies and to develop
practical applications of engineering.
