# UCEST105 : Algorithmic Thinking with Python

## Course Objectives
1. To provide students with a thorough understanding of algorithmic thinking and its practical applications in solving real-world problems.
2. To explore various algorithmic paradigms, including brute force, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and heuristics, in addressing and solving complex problems.

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Problem-Solving Strategies and Essentials of Python
- Problem-solving strategies: Trial and Error, Heuristics, Means-Ends Analysis, Backtracking (Working backward)
- The problem-solving process: Computer as a model of computation, understanding the problem, formulating a model, developing an algorithm, writing the program, testing, and evaluating
- Essentials of Python programming:
  - Variables, numeric and string data types
  - Using the math module and Python Standard Library for basic I/O
  - Python operators and their precedence

**Contact Hours:** 7

### Module 2: Algorithm and Pseudocode Representation; Flowcharts
- Algorithm and Pseudocode:
  - Definition and purpose of pseudocode
  - Constructs: sequencing, selection (if-else, case), repetition (for, while, repeat-until)
  - Sample problems: evaluating expressions, simple interest, largest of numbers, grade calculation, sum of n numbers, factorial, etc.
- Flowcharts:
  - Symbols: start/end, arithmetic calculations, input/output, decision, module call, loops, connectors
  - Visualizing control flow using tools like RAPTOR

**Contact Hours:** 9

### Module 3: Selection, Iteration, Decomposition, and Recursion
- Selection and iteration in Python: if-else, elif, for loop, range, while loop
- Sequence data types: list, tuple, set, strings, dictionary
- Arrays in Python using Numpy
- Decomposition and modularization:
  - Problem decomposition and modularization
  - Defining and using functions with multiple return values
  - Examples: merge sort, top 3 integers from a list
- Recursion:
  - Definition, call stack, avoiding circularity
  - Sample problems: nth Fibonacci, GCD, factorial, sum of digits

**Contact Hours:** 10

### Module 4: Computational Approaches to Problem-Solving
- Brute-force Approach (Example: padlock, password guessing)
- Divide-and-Conquer Approach (Example: merge sort)
  - Advantages and disadvantages
- Dynamic Programming (Example: Fibonacci series)
- Greedy Algorithm Approach:
  - Example: Maximum number of tasks in limited time
  - Characteristics and comparison with dynamic programming
- Randomized Approach:
  - Example 1: Collecting coupons for free jeans
  - Example 2: Hat-check problem at a party
  - Motivations and applications
