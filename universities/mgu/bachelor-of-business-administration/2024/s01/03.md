 This course has been introduced as part of BBA programs because quantitative aptitude tests are a key component in competitive exams globally. Business Statistics helps us to make business decisions under uncertainties, which must be objective and based on quantitative data.With business entities keen on making data-driven decisions it is essential for individuals working in this uncertain environment to possess such skills.
