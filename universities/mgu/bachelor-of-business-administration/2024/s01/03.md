# MG1CCRBBA102 - Business Statistics and Logic

[cite_start]This course has been introduced as part of BBA programs because quantitative aptitude tests are a key component in competitive exams globally. [cite: 1540] [cite_start]Business Statistics helps us to make business decisions under uncertainties, which must be objective and based on quantitative data. [cite: 1540] [cite_start]With business entities keen on making data-driven decisions it is essential for individuals working in this uncertain environment to possess such skills. [cite: 1540]
