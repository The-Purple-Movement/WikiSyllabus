## Course Objective
This course introduces students to the fundamental principles of computer programming using Python. It emphasizes problem-solving, algorithm design, and structured programming concepts essential for computational thinking.

## Course Outcomes
- **CO 1:** Write simple, well-structured programs in Python.  
- **CO 2:** Understand variables, data types, control structures, functions, and classes.  
- **CO 3:** Design, implement, and test solutions to computational problems.  
- **CO 4:** Demonstrate an understanding of recursion and algorithmic complexity.  
- **CO 5:** Apply good programming style and documentation practices.

### Module 2 – Functions and Modularity
Functions: definition, parameters, return values, and scope.  
Lists, tuples, and dictionaries – operations and applications.  

### Module 3 – File I/O and Exceptions
File handling: reading and writing text files.  
Exception handling and debugging techniques.  
Introduction to object-oriented programming: classes, objects, methods, and inheritance.  

### Module 4 – Recursion and Algorithms
Recursive functions and their applications.  
Algorithmic efficiency and complexity analysis.  
Searching and sorting algorithms: linear search, binary search, and sorting methods.  

### Module 5 – Final Project and Review
Integrating programming concepts in a capstone project.  
Software testing, debugging, and documentation best practices.
