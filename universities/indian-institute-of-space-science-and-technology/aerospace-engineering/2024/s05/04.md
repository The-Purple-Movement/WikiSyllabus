# ae303c: flight-mechanics-i
  - (AE303C: Flight Mechanics I)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamentals of aircraft performance and static stability.  
* To analyze the forces and moments acting on an aircraft in steady and accelerated flight.  
* To study the performance characteristics related to take-off, landing, climb, and cruise.  
* To understand longitudinal and lateral static stability criteria.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction to Flight Mechanics
* Reference frames and coordinate systems.  
* Types of aircraft motions and forces.  
* Lift, drag, thrust, and weight components.  
* Aircraft equations of motion (qualitative).  
* Performance and stability as major analysis domains.  

### Module 2: Steady Level and Accelerated Flight
* Conditions for steady level flight.  
* Thrust required and power required curves.  
* Range and endurance of propeller-driven and jet aircraft.  
* Climb and glide performance.  
* Turning performance — load factor, turn radius, and rate of turn.  

### Module 3: Take-Off and Landing Performance
* Take-off run and ground roll analysis.  
* Balanced field length.  
* Landing distance and approach control.  
* Influence of wind, flaps, and aircraft mass.  
* Performance constraints for aircraft design.  

### Module 4: Static Longitudinal Stability and Control
* Static stability concepts — restoring moments and equilibrium.  
* Contribution of wing, tail, and fuselage to stability.  
* Neutral point and static margin.  
* Elevator control effectiveness.  
* Trim conditions for steady flight.  

### Module 5: Lateral and Directional Static Stability
* Sideslip and lateral-directional derivatives.  
* Dihedral effect and roll stability.  
* Weathercock stability and fin design.  
* Rudder control and directional trim.  
* Coupling between roll–yaw motions.
