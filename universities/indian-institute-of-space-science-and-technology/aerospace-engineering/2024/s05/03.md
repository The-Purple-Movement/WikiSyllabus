  - (AE302C: Aerospace Structures II)

## Course Objectives
* To extend the principles of solid mechanics to advanced aerospace structural components.  
* To study shear flow, torsion, and bending in thin-walled members.  
* To introduce energy methods and structural stability concepts.  
* To prepare students for aircraft structural design and analysis applications.
