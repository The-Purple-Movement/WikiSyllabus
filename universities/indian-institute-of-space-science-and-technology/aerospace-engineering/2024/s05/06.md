# ae381h: flight-mechanics-laboratory
  - (AE381H: Flight Mechanics Laboratory)

## Course Objectives
* To experimentally study aircraft performance and stability characteristics.  
* To provide hands-on experience with flight data, instrumentation, and analysis tools.  
* To verify theoretical concepts from Flight Mechanics I through experiments and simulations.  
* To develop skills in aerodynamic data reduction, interpretation, and reporting.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction to Flight Experiments
* Familiarization with flight mechanics laboratory setup.  
* Introduction to flight test instrumentation.  
* Data acquisition and signal processing.  
* Calibration of sensors (pressure, velocity, angle).  

### Module 2: Performance Measurements
* Measurement of lift, drag, and moment coefficients.  
* Determination of thrust required and power required curves.  
* Estimation of stall characteristics.  
* Range and endurance analysis (data-driven).  

### Module 3: Stability Experiments
* Longitudinal static stability – determination of neutral point and static margin.  
* Elevator control effectiveness.  
* Lateral–directional stability – dihedral effect and weathercock stability.  
* Control derivative estimation (via experiments or simulation).  

### Module 4: Flight Dynamics and Simulation
* Use of flight simulation software/tools.  
* Aircraft response to step and impulse control inputs.  
* Short-period and phugoid mode identification (simulation-based).  
* Spiral, Dutch roll, and roll subsidence modes.  

### Module 5: Data Processing and Report Preparation
* Data filtering, error estimation, and uncertainty analysis.  
* Comparison of experimental, theoretical, and simulation data.  
* Preparation of structured flight test reports.  
* Case studies from real aircraft flight tests (intro).
