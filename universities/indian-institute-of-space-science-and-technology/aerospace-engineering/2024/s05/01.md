  - (MA301C: Numerical Methods and Optimization)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce numerical techniques for solving algebraic and differential equations.  
* To develop computational skills for interpolation, curve fitting, and numerical integration.  
* To understand optimization principles and apply them to engineering problems.  
* To prepare students for numerical simulation and analysis in aerospace applications.
