# ae301c: compressible-aerodynamics
  - (AE301C: Compressible Aerodynamics)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamental principles of compressible flow and high-speed aerodynamics.  
* To study isentropic flow, normal and oblique shocks, and their applications.  
* To understand the behaviour of nozzles, diffusers, and high-speed aerodynamic devices.  
* To apply compressible flow analysis to aerospace propulsion and aerodynamic design.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Fundamentals of Compressible Flow
* Definition of compressibility and compressible flow regimes.  
* Speed of sound and Mach number.  
* Stagnation properties and isentropic relations.  
* Introduction to area–velocity relation.  
* Applications in nozzles, diffusers, and high-speed systems.  

### Module 2: One-Dimensional Isentropic Flow
* Isentropic flow through variable-area ducts.  
* Choked flow and critical conditions.  
* Area–Mach number relation.  
* Flow in convergent and convergent–divergent nozzles.  
* Applications in propulsion and high-speed wind tunnels.  

### Module 3: Normal Shocks
* Conservation equations across a shock.  
* Normal shock relations – pressure, temperature, density, Mach number.  
* Stagnation property changes across shocks.  
* Fanno flow and Rayleigh flow fundamentals.  
* Applications in supersonic intakes and propulsion devices.  

### Module 4: Oblique Shocks and Expansion Waves

* Shock polar and shock wave interactions.  
* Prandtl–Meyer expansion waves.  
* Supersonic flow past wedges and cones.  
* Application in supersonic airfoils and high-speed vehicles.  

### Module 5: Compressible Flow Applications
* High-speed wind tunnels – operation and instrumentation.  
* Supersonic and hypersonic flows (overview).  
* Shock–boundary layer interaction.  
* Design considerations for supersonic inlets and nozzles.  
* Computational methods in compressible aerodynamics (intro).
