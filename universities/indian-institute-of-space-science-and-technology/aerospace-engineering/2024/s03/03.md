# ae202c: thermodynamics-and-heat-transfer
  - (AE202C: Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer)

## Course Objectives
* To understand the basic concepts and laws of thermodynamics and their engineering applications.  
* To analyse energy conversion systems and thermodynamic cycles.  
* To introduce principles of heat transfer – conduction, convection, and radiation.  
* To apply thermodynamics and heat transfer concepts in aerospace and propulsion systems.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Basic Concepts and First Law of Thermodynamics
* System, control volume, properties, and state.  
* Zeroth law and temperature scales.  
* Work and heat interactions.  
* First law for closed and open systems.  
* Steady-flow energy equation and applications.  

### Module 2: Second Law and Entropy
* Limitations of the first law.  
* Heat engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps.  
* Kelvin–Planck and Clausius statements of the second law.  
* Reversible and irreversible processes.  
* Entropy and the increase of entropy principle.  

### Module 3: Thermodynamic Cycles and Gas Mixtures
* Carnot, Otto, Diesel, and Brayton cycles – efficiency and performance.  
* Rankine cycle and regenerative cycles (overview).  
* Ideal and real gas mixtures.  
* Partial pressures and psychrometrics (basic concepts).  
* Relevance of thermodynamic cycles to aerospace propulsion.  

### Module 4: Heat Conduction and Convection
* Modes of heat transfer.  
* Fourier’s law and thermal conductivity.  
* One-dimensional steady-state heat conduction in plane and cylindrical walls.  
* Thermal resistance network.  
* Convection – forced and natural, heat transfer coefficients, and empirical correlations.  

### Module 5: Radiation and Heat Exchangers
* Fundamentals of thermal radiation – blackbody and graybody concepts.  
* Stefan–Boltzmann and Wien’s laws.  
* View factors and radiation exchange between surfaces.  
* Classification and analysis of heat exchangers.  
* Applications in aerospace thermal management.
