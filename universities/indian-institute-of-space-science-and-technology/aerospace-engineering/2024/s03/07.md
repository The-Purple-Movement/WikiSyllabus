# ae232h: thermodynamics-and-heat-transfer-laboratory
  - (AE232H: Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer Laboratory)

## Course Objectives
* To experimentally study the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and heat transfer.  
* To provide hands-on experience in performance testing of thermal systems and components.  
* To familiarise students with data acquisition, measurement, and result interpretation techniques.  
* To relate theoretical and numerical predictions with practical observations.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Thermodynamics Experiments
* Performance test on a single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine.  
* Determination of thermal efficiency and brake power.  
* Study of two-stroke petrol engine (demonstration).  
* Determination of calorific value of fuels using a bomb calorimeter.  
* Measurement of air–fuel ratio and volumetric efficiency.  

### Module 2: Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Systems
* Performance test on a vapour compression refrigeration system.  
* Study of psychrometric processes – cooling, heating, humidification, and dehumidification.  
* Determination of COP and refrigerating effect.  
* Demonstration of air-conditioning test rig and measurement of air properties.  

### Module 3: Heat Transfer Experiments
* Determination of thermal conductivity of metal rods.  
* Verification of Fourier’s law of heat conduction.  
* Study of forced convection heat transfer from a horizontal cylinder.  
* Determination of heat transfer coefficient in natural convection.  
* Stefan–Boltzmann law verification for radiation.  

### Module 4: Data Analysis and Interpretation
* Experimental uncertainty and error estimation.  
* Preparation of calibration curves and graphs.  
* Correlation of experimental data with analytical and simulation results.  
* Preparation of technical reports and discussion of results.
