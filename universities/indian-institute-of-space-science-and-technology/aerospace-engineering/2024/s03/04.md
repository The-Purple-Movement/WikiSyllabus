# ae203c: engineering-mechanics
  - (AE203C: Engineering Mechanics)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamental principles of statics and dynamics of particles and rigid bodies.  
* To develop the ability to analyse engineering systems using vector mechanics.  
* To apply the laws of mechanics to aerospace and mechanical components.  
* To build the foundation for advanced courses in structural and flight mechanics.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction and Force Systems
* Basic concepts of mechanics – particles, rigid bodies, scalars, and vectors.  
* Force, moment, and couple systems.  
* Resultant of concurrent and non-concurrent force systems.  
* Resolution and composition of forces.  
* Free-body diagrams and equilibrium conditions.  

### Module 2: Equilibrium of Rigid Bodies
* Two and three dimensional equilibrium.  
* Equilibrium of planar systems using analytical and graphical methods.  
* Support reactions in beams and frames.  
* Trusses – method of joints and method of sections.  
* Friction and applications in wedges and screws.  

### Module 3: Centroid, Moment of Inertia, and Virtual Work
* Centroid and centre of gravity of lines, areas, and volumes.  
* Moment of inertia and product of inertia – parallel and perpendicular axis theorems.  
* Radius of gyration.  
* Principle of virtual work and its applications in equilibrium analysis.  

### Module 4: Kinematics of Particles and Rigid Bodies
* Rectilinear and curvilinear motion – displacement, velocity, and acceleration.  
* Relative motion of particles.  
* Plane motion of rigid bodies – translation and rotation.  
* Instantaneous centre of rotation.  
* Applications in linkage and rotor dynamics.  

### Module 5: Kinetics and Work–Energy Methods
* Newton’s second law, D’Alembert’s principle.  
* Work–energy and impulse–momentum principles.  
* Conservation of energy and momentum.  
* Collision of bodies.  
* Applications to aerospace structures and vehicle motion.
