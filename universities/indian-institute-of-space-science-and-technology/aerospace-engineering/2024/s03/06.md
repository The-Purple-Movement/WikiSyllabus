  - (AE231H: Fluid Mechanics Laboratory)

## Course Objectives
* To provide experimental verification of theoretical concepts in fluid mechanics.  
* To train students in the use of flow measurement devices and data acquisition systems.  
* To develop practical skills in analysing flow behaviour, losses, and coefficients.  
* To correlate experimental data with theoretical and computational predictions.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Flow Measurement Experiments
* Determination of discharge coefficients for venturimeter and orificemeter.  
* Calibration of notches and weirs.  
* Determination of flow rate using a rotameter.  
* Study of flow through nozzles and orifices.  

### Module 2: Energy and Momentum Experiments
* Verification of Bernoulli’s theorem.  
* Impact of jet on vanes – force and coefficient determination.  
* Determination of loss of head in pipes, bends, and fittings.  
* Study of hydraulic turbines (demonstration).  

### Module 3: Boundary Layer and Laminar Flow Studies
* Determination of friction factor for laminar and turbulent flow.  
* Measurement of velocity profiles in laminar and turbulent pipe flow.  
* Visualization of boundary layer separation.  
* Determination of Reynolds number for transition.  

### Module 4: Flow Visualization and Data Analysis
* Flow visualization using Reynolds apparatus or dye-injection method.  
* Measurement of static and total pressure using Pitot-static tube.  
* Dimensional analysis of experimental results.  
* Preparation of technical reports with error estimation and result interpretation.
