# ae201c: fluid-mechanics
  - (AE201C: Fluid Mechanics)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamentals of fluid properties and behaviour under various conditions.  
* To formulate and apply governing equations of fluid motion.  
* To study fluid statics, kinematics, and dynamics relevant to aerospace applications.  
* To analyse internal and external flows using theoretical and experimental approaches.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction and Fluid Properties
* Definition of a fluid and continuum hypothesis.  
* Fluid properties – density, viscosity, compressibility, surface tension, vapour pressure.  
* Classification of fluids – ideal, real, Newtonian, non-Newtonian.  
* Pressure at a point, Pascal’s law, and measurement devices.  
* Engineering relevance in aerodynamics and propulsion.  

### Module 2: Fluid Statics
* Pressure variation in a static fluid.  
* Manometers, differential pressure gauges.  
* Forces on plane and curved submerged surfaces.  
* Buoyancy, stability of floating bodies, and metacentre.  
* Applications in aircraft fuel and hydraulic systems.  

### Module 3: Fluid Kinematics
* Description of fluid motion – Eulerian and Lagrangian methods.  
* Streamlines, pathlines, streaklines.  
* Velocity potential and stream function.  
* Rotational and irrotational flows, circulation, and vorticity.  
* Continuity equation in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates.  

### Module 4: Fluid Dynamics
* Control-volume approach and Reynolds transport theorem.  
* Bernoulli’s equation – derivation and limitations.  
* Momentum and energy equations.  
* Applications – flow through nozzles, diffusers, venturimeter, orificemeter.  
* Introduction to compressible flow concepts.  

### Module 5: Flow in Pipes and Boundaries
* Laminar and turbulent flow in circular pipes – Reynolds experiment.  
* Darcy–Weisbach equation, friction factor, and head loss.  
* Boundary-layer concept, separation, and drag.
