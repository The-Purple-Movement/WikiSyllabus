# ae111c: thermodynamics
  - (AE111C: Thermodynamics)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the basic principles and concepts of classical thermodynamics.  
* To apply thermodynamic laws in the analysis of engineering systems.  
* To understand the behavior of pure substances and ideal gases in various processes.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Fundamental Concepts and First Law of Thermodynamics
* System, control volume, properties, state, process and cycle.  
* Quasi-static process, temperature and pressure.  
* Energy – work and heat – first law of thermodynamics for a system and control volume.  
* Internal energy and enthalpy.  
* Application of first law to steady-flow and non-flow processes.  

### Module 2: Second Law of Thermodynamics
* Limitations of the first law.  
* Thermal reservoir, heat engine, refrigerator and heat pump.  
* Kelvin–Planck and Clausius statements.  
* Reversible and irreversible processes – Carnot cycle.  
* Clausius inequality and entropy.  

### Module 3: Pure Substances and Ideal Gases
* Phase change processes and property diagrams.  
* Equation of state for a pure substance.  
* Ideal gas law and other equations of state.  
* Evaluation of properties – internal energy, enthalpy and entropy for ideal gases.  

### Module 4: Thermodynamic Relations
* Maxwell relations, specific heats, Joule–Thomson coefficient.  
* Clausius–Clapeyron equation.  
* General relations for change of properties and their applications.  

### Module 5: Thermodynamic Cycles
* Air-standard cycles: Otto, Diesel and Brayton cycles.  
* Rankine cycle and its modifications.  
* Refrigeration and heat pump cycles – reversed Carnot, vapor-compression cycle.
