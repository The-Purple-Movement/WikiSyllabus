  - (MA112V: Computer Programming and Applications)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamentals of programming using the C language.  
* To provide students with problem-solving techniques through algorithms and structured programming.  
* To develop applications involving arrays, functions, structures, and file handling in C.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction to Computers and Programming Concepts
* Computer organization overview, operating systems, and compilers.  
* Algorithms and flowcharts.  
* Structure of a C program, compiling, linking, and executing.  
* Variables, constants, data types, operators, and expressions.  
* Input and output statements, precedence and associativity.  

### Module 2: Control Flow and Functions
* Conditional statements – if, if-else, switch.  
* Looping constructs – while, do-while, for.  
* Break and continue statements.  
* Functions – declaration, definition, and calling.  
* Parameter passing – call by value and call by reference.  
* Recursion and storage classes.  

### Module 3: Arrays and Strings
* One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.  
* Operations on arrays, linear search, and sorting techniques.  
* String handling – standard library functions, character arrays, and string manipulation.  

### Module 4: Pointers and Structures
* Pointers – declaration, initialization, and dereferencing.  
* Pointer arithmetic and dynamic memory allocation.  
* Arrays of pointers and pointers to arrays.  
* Structures and unions – declaration, initialization, and access.  
* Structures within structures and arrays of structures.  

### Module 5: File Handling and Applications
* File operations – opening, reading, writing, and closing files.  
* Sequential and random file access.  
* Command-line arguments.  
* Case studies and simple engineering applications.
