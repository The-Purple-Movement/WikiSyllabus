# MA111C: Calculus

## Course Objectives
* To understand the fundamental concepts of limits, continuity, derivatives, and integrals.
* To apply calculus techniques in solving problems involving functions of one or more variables.
* To introduce the concepts of convergence, power series, and applications of calculus in engineering.

## Course Content

### Module 1: Sequence and Series of Real Numbers
* Sequence – convergence – limit of sequence – non-decreasing sequence theorem – sandwich theorem (applications)
* L'Hopital's rule
* Infinite series – convergence – geometric series
* Tests of convergence (nth term test, integral test, comparison test, ratio and root test)
* Alternating series and conditional convergence – power series

### Module 2: Differential Calculus
* Functions of one variable – limits, continuity and derivatives
* Taylor’s theorem – applications of derivatives – curvature and asymptotes
* Functions of two variables – limits and continuity – partial derivatives
* Differentiability, linearization and differentials
* Extremum of functions – Lagrange multipliers

### Module 3: Integral Calculus
* Lower and upper integral – Riemann integral and its properties
* The fundamental theorem of integral calculus – mean value theorems
* Differentiation under integral sign
* Double and triple integrals – change of variable in double integrals
* Polar and spherical transforms – Jacobian of transformations
