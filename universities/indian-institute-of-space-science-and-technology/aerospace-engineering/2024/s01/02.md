# ph113c: engineering-physics
  - (PH113C: Engineering Physics)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamental principles of mechanics, modern physics, and optics.  
* To provide a foundational understanding of vector analysis, statics, and kinematics relevant to engineering applications.  
* To develop problem-solving skills in physics for use in aerospace and engineering disciplines.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Vectors, Statics, and Kinematics
* Introduction to vectors (linear independence, completeness, basis, dimensionality)  
* Inner products, orthogonality  
* Principles of statics, system of forces in plane and space, conditions of equilibrium  
* Displacement, derivatives of a vector, velocity, acceleration  
* Kinematic equations, motion in plane polar coordinates  

### Module 2: Angular Momentum
* Angular momentum and torque on a single particle  
* Angular momentum and torque on a system of particles  
* Moment of inertia – angular momentum of a rigid body  

### Module 3: Modern Physics
* Relativity – introduction to quantum physics – atom model – hydrogen atom  
* Photoelectric effect – blackbody radiation – wave–matter duality – uncertainty principle – Compton scattering  

### Module 4: Optics
* Nature of light – ray approximation in geometrical optics – reflection – refraction – Fermat’s principle  
* Dispersion – mirrors and lenses – aberrations – interference – diffraction – polarization – lasers  

### Module 5: Harmonic Oscillator
* 1-D harmonic oscillator – damped and forced harmonic oscillators
