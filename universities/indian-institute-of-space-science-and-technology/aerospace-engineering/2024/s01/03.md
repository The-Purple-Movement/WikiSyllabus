# ch111c: engineering-chemistry
  - (CH111C: Engineering Chemistry)

## Course Objectives
* To provide a fundamental understanding of chemical kinetics, spectroscopy, polymers, and propellants relevant to aerospace engineering.  
* To develop knowledge of chemical principles and applications in propulsion and materials.  
* To strengthen analytical thinking through chemistry-based laboratory and theoretical learning.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Kinetic Theory of Gases and Chemical Kinetics
* Kinetic theory of gases: Introduction, collision theory, estimation of gas properties.  
* Chemical Kinetics: Introduction, elementary and complex reactions, rate law expressions, effect of temperature on reaction rates, catalysis.  

### Module 2: Spectroscopy
* UV-Visible Spectroscopy – fundamentals, Beer-Lambert’s law, electronic transitions, empirical rules for prediction of λmax.  
* IR Spectroscopy – fundamentals, identification of functional groups.  

### Module 3: Polymers
* Introduction – molecular weights of polymers.  
* Polymerization mechanisms – radical, ionic, and condensation.  
* Structure–property relations and applications.  

### Module 4: Propellants
* Classification of propellants, performance of propellants and thermochemistry.  
* Liquid propellants – oxidizers and fuels.  
* Solid propellants – composite solid propellants, burning ignition, and rate of burning.  
* Factors affecting rate of burning.
