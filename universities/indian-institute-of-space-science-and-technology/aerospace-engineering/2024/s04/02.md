# ae204c: aerodynamics-i
  - (AE204C: Aerodynamics I)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamental principles of aerodynamics and fluid motion over aerodynamic bodies.  
* To develop understanding of inviscid, incompressible flow theory and potential flow models.  
* To explain lift and drag generation through airfoil and wing theory.  
* To lay the foundation for compressible flow and advanced aerodynamic analysis.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction and Basic Concepts
* Overview of aerodynamics and its role in aerospace engineering.  
* Flow regimes – incompressible, compressible, viscous, inviscid.  
* Continuum hypothesis and governing parameters.  
* Dimensional analysis and similarity principles.  
* Review of fluid mechanics equations in aerodynamics context.  

### Module 2: Kinematics of Fluid Flow

* Elementary potential flows – source, sink, doublet, vortex, and uniform flow.  
* Superposition of flows and flow past cylinders.  
* Pressure distribution and application of Bernoulli’s theorem.  
* Flow over symmetric and non-symmetric bodies.
