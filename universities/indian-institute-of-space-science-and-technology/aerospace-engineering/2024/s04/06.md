  - (AE242H: Aerospace Structures and Propulsion Laboratory)

## Course Objectives
* To experimentally study the behaviour of structural components and propulsion systems.  
* To provide hands-on experience in testing of materials and propulsion subsystems.  
* To analyse experimental data related to stress, strain, and performance characteristics.  
* To correlate theoretical, computational, and experimental results in aerospace applications.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Structural Mechanics Experiments
* Determination of Young’s modulus of materials using deflection and tension tests.  
* Verification of bending equation for beams.  
* Study of strain distribution using strain gauges.  
* Torsion test on circular shafts.  
* Buckling of columns and Euler’s theory validation.  

### Module 2: Material Strength and Hardness Testing
* Tensile and compression tests on metallic specimens.  
* Hardness testing – Brinell, Rockwell, and Vickers methods.  
* Impact testing using Charpy and Izod tests.  
* Fatigue test (demonstration).  
* Fracture analysis and failure modes.  

### Module 3: Propulsion Experiments
* Performance analysis of a subsonic jet engine test rig (demonstration).  
* Determination of thrust and specific fuel consumption.  
* Study of compressor characteristics.  
* Performance evaluation of a small-scale rocket motor (demonstration).  
* Measurement of exhaust velocity and thrust coefficient.  

### Module 4: Data Analysis and Correlation
