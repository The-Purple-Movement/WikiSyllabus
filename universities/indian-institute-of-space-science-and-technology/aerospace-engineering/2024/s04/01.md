# ma202c: probability-and-statistics
  - (MA202C: Probability and Statistics)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamental principles of probability theory and random variables.  
* To provide tools for analyzing and interpreting data using statistical techniques.  
* To develop problem-solving skills in uncertainty quantification and reliability analysis.  
* To apply probability and statistics in engineering and aerospace contexts.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Probability Concepts
* Basic definitions and axioms of probability.  
* Conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem.  
* Independent and dependent events.  
* Random experiments and sample space.  
* Applications of probability in aerospace engineering.  

### Module 2: Random Variables and Probability Distributions
* Discrete and continuous random variables.  
* Probability mass and density functions.  
* Expectation, variance, and moments.  
* Common distributions – binomial, Poisson, uniform, exponential, and normal.  
* Joint, marginal, and conditional distributions.  

### Module 3: Sampling and Estimation
* Sampling methods and central limit theorem.  
* Point and interval estimation.  
* Properties of estimators – unbiasedness, efficiency, consistency.  
* Maximum likelihood and method of moments estimation.  
* Confidence intervals for mean, variance, and proportion.  

### Module 4: Hypothesis Testing and Regression
* Formulation of statistical hypotheses.  
* Type I and Type II errors, level of significance.  
* Tests for mean, variance, and proportions (z, t, χ², F-tests).  
* Correlation and regression analysis.  
* Simple linear regression and least-squares method.  

### Module 5: Applications and Reliability Analysis
* Quality control – control charts for variables and attributes.  
* Introduction to analysis of variance (ANOVA).  
* Reliability of systems and failure probabilities.  
* Introduction to random processes and Markov chains.  
* Applications of statistical methods in aerospace system design.
