# ae241h: aerodynamics-laboratory
  - (AE241H: Aerodynamics Laboratory)

## Course Objectives
* To provide experimental understanding of aerodynamic principles and flow behaviour.  
* To verify theoretical results from aerodynamics and fluid mechanics courses.  
* To familiarize students with wind-tunnel testing and instrumentation techniques.  
* To develop skills in data analysis, error estimation, and aerodynamic report preparation.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Flow Visualization and Pressure Measurement
* Study of flow visualization over airfoils and bluff bodies.  
* Calibration and use of pressure-measuring devices – manometers, transducers.  
* Measurement of static and total pressure using Pitot-static tube.  
* Flow visualization using smoke or tufts.  

### Module 2: Airfoil and Cylinder Experiments
* Pressure distribution over symmetric and cambered airfoils.  
* Determination of lift and drag coefficients.  
* Effect of angle of attack on aerodynamic characteristics.  
* Flow over circular cylinders – drag and vortex shedding.  

### Module 3: Boundary Layer and Wake Studies
* Measurement of velocity profile in boundary layers.  
* Determination of boundary-layer thickness and shape factor.  
* Flow separation and control techniques.  
* Study of wake profiles behind airfoils and bodies.  

### Module 4: Wind-Tunnel Operations
* Familiarization with subsonic wind tunnel setup.  
* Calibration of balances and instrumentation.  
* Experimental procedure for aerodynamic testing.  
* Data acquisition, reduction, and analysis.  

### Module 5: Data Processing and Report Preparation
* Uncertainty analysis and experimental error estimation.  
* Preparation of test reports and result interpretation.  
* Comparison of experimental and theoretical results.  
* Documentation and presentation of aerodynamic data.
