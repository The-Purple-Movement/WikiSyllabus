# ae205c: aerospace-structures-i
  - (AE205C: Aerospace Structures I)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamental concepts of stress, strain, and deformation in aerospace structures.  
* To develop analytical skills for structural analysis under different loading conditions.  
* To study torsion, bending, and shear in beams and shafts used in aircraft design.  
* To provide the foundation for advanced courses in structural analysis and design.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction to Mechanics of Materials
* Concept of stress and strain – normal and shear components.  
* Hooke’s law and elastic constants – E, G, and ν.  
* Plane stress and plane strain conditions.  
* Stress–strain relationships for isotropic materials.  
* Introduction to composite material behavior (qualitative).  

### Module 2: Axial Load and Thermal Stress
* Analysis of bars subjected to axial loads.  
* Stress–strain diagrams and determination of modulus of elasticity.  
* Deformation under axial loading – statically determinate and indeterminate cases.  
* Thermal stresses in constrained members.  
* Applications to fuselage and truss members.  

### Module 3: Torsion of Circular Shafts
* Torsion formula and assumptions.  
* Angle of twist and torsional rigidity.  
* Power transmitted by shafts.  
* Shear stress distribution and strain energy due to torsion.  
* Thin-walled circular tubes – applications in aerospace shafts.  

### Module 4: Bending of Beams
* Theory of simple bending – assumptions and derivation.  
* Shear and bending moment diagrams.  
* Bending stress distribution and section modulus.  
* Deflection of beams using double integration and Macaulay’s method.  
* Introduction to curved beams and unsymmetrical bending.  

### Module 5: Shear Flow and Shear Center
* Shear stress in thin-walled open and closed sections.  
* Shear center for common sections (I, channel, angle).  
* Shear flow in multicell structures and stiffened panels.  
* Introduction to aircraft semi-monocoque structures.  
* Application to wing and fuselage design.
