## Course Objectives
* To provide hands-on experience in fundamental experiments related to fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and material testing.  
* To familiarize students with the experimental techniques and data analysis used in aerospace engineering.  
* To develop skills in experimental setup, measurement, error estimation, and result interpretation.  
* To establish a practical understanding of theoretical concepts covered in core courses.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Fluid Mechanics Experiments
* Determination of discharge coefficient for flow through a venturi meter and orifice meter.  
* Verification of Bernoulli’s theorem.  
* Study of flow visualization using Reynolds apparatus.  
* Determination of friction factor for flow through pipes.  
* Measurement of static and total pressures using pitot-static tube.  

### Module 2: Thermodynamics Experiments
* Performance test on a single-cylinder diesel engine.  
* Determination of thermal conductivity of a metal rod.  
* Verification of Stefan–Boltzmann law.  
* Determination of specific heat capacity of liquids using calorimeter.  
* Study of refrigeration and air-conditioning test rig.  

### Module 3: Material Testing Experiments
* Tension test on mild steel specimen using a universal testing machine (UTM).  
* Compression test on concrete or aluminum specimens.  
* Impact test (Izod/Charpy) to determine impact strength.  
* Hardness test – Brinell, Rockwell, or Vickers methods.  
* Study of strain measurement using strain gauges.  

### Module 4: Data Analysis and Report Writing
* Experimental uncertainty, error analysis, and calibration techniques.  
* Graphical and tabular representation of experimental results.  
* Preparation of laboratory reports with interpretation of outcomes.  
* Correlation of experimental data with theoretical models.
