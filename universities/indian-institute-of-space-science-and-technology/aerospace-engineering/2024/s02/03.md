# ae121c: engineering-graphics
  - (AE121C: Engineering Graphics)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamentals of engineering drawing and visualization of 2D and 3D objects.  
* To impart the skill of converting design concepts into accurate graphical representations.  
* To familiarize students with projection systems, sectional views, and isometric drawing.  
* To prepare students for computer-aided graphical communication in aerospace and mechanical domains.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction to Engineering Drawing
* Importance and role of engineering drawing as a language of engineers.  
* BIS standards and conventions.  
* Types of lines, lettering, and dimensioning.  
* Use of drawing instruments and introduction to CAD tools.  
* Geometrical constructions – bisection, tangents, polygons, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola.  

### Module 2: Orthographic Projections
* Principles of orthographic projection – first angle and third angle systems.  
* Projection of points, straight lines, and plane surfaces.  
* Traces of lines and planes.  
* Projection of solids – prism, pyramid, cylinder, cone, and sphere in simple positions.  

### Module 3: Sectional Views and Development of Surfaces
* Sectional views of solids – cutting plane representation and conventions.  
* True shape of section and use in design interpretation.  
* Development of surfaces – prism, cylinder, cone, pyramid, and transition pieces.  
* Applications in sheet-metal design and aerospace component fabrication.  

### Module 4: Isometric Projection
* Isometric axes, lines, and planes.  
* Isometric scale and isometric projection of simple objects.  
* Conversion of orthographic views into isometric views and vice versa.  
* Visualization of complex aerospace components in isometric projection.  

### Module 5: Introduction to Computer-Aided Drafting (CAD)
* Basics of CAD software for 2D drafting.  
* Drawing commands – line, circle, arc, polygon, fillet, trim, mirror, offset, etc.  
* Dimensioning, layer management, and text editing.  
* Plotting and printing of CAD drawings.  
* Integration of CAD with design workflows in aerospace applications.
