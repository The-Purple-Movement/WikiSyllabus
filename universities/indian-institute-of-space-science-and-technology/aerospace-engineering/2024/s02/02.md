# ph123c: semiconductor-physics-and-quantum-mechanics
  - (PH123C: Semiconductor Physics and Quantum Mechanics)

## Course Objectives
* To introduce the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics underlying modern semiconductor physics.  
* To provide an understanding of crystal structure, band theory, and charge-carrier dynamics.  
* To apply quantum principles to explain electronic and optical behaviour in semiconductors.  
* To develop analytical skills for solving basic problems in quantum and solid-state physics.  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Crystal Structure and Bonding
* Lattice, basis, and unit cell – Bravais lattices and crystal systems.  
* Miller indices and interplanar spacing.  
* Crystal structures of Si and GaAs – diamond and zinc-blende.  
* Types of bonding in solids: ionic, covalent, metallic, van der Waals, hydrogen.  
* Coordination number, packing fraction, and crystal imperfections.  

### Module 2: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics
* Historical background – inadequacy of classical physics.  
* Photoelectric effect, Compton effect, and de Broglie hypothesis.  
* Heisenberg uncertainty principle and wave–particle duality.  
* Wave function and Born interpretation.  
* Schrödinger’s equation (time-dependent and time-independent forms).  
* Probability current density and normalization.  

### Module 3: Applications of Schrödinger Equation
* Particle in a one-dimensional potential box – energy quantization.  
* Potential step and potential barrier – quantum tunnelling.  
* Simple harmonic oscillator (qualitative discussion).  
* Hydrogen atom – energy levels and quantum numbers.  
* Degeneracy and selection rules (qualitative).  

### Module 4: Band Theory of Solids
* Free-electron theory – Fermi–Dirac statistics and Fermi energy.  
* Kronig–Penney model – concept of allowed and forbidden bands.  
* Distinction between conductors, semiconductors, and insulators.  
* Effective mass of an electron and density of states.  
* Concept of holes and intrinsic semiconductor behaviour.  

### Module 5: Semiconductor Physics
* Intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors – donors and acceptors.  
* Carrier concentration and Fermi-level position.  
* Conductivity and mobility – temperature dependence.  
* p–n junction – depletion region, built-in potential, and diode characteristics.  
* Optical transitions and photoconductivity.  
* Introduction to semiconductor devices – LEDs and photodiodes (qualitative).
