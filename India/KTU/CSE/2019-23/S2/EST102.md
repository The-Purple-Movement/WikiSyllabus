# EST102: Programming in C

## Course Outcomes

- **CO1**: Analyze a computational problem and develop an algorithm/flowchart to find its solution.  
- **CO2**: Develop readable C programs with branching and looping statements, using arithmetic, logical, relational, or bitwise operators.  
- **CO3**: Write readable C programs using arrays, structures, or unions for data storage and processing.  
- **CO4**: Divide a computational problem into modules and develop a readable multi-function C program using recursion when necessary.  
- **CO5**: Write readable C programs using pointers for array processing and parameter passing.  
- **CO6**: Develop readable C programs using files for input and output operations.

## Course Content

### Module 1: Basics of Computer Hardware and Software

Basics of computer architecture – processor, memory, input and output devices.  
Application software and system software – compilers, interpreters, high-level and low-level languages.  
Introduction to structured programming.  
Flowcharts, algorithms, and pseudocode – examples with bubble sort and linear search.

### Module 2: Program Basics

Basic structure of a C program.  
Character set, tokens, identifiers, variables, data types, and constants.  
Console I/O operations – `printf()` and `scanf()`.  
Operators and expressions – arithmetic, relational, logical, conditional, bitwise, `sizeof`, and assignment operators.  
Operator precedence and associativity.  
Control flow statements – `if`, `switch`, `goto`, loops (`while`, `do-while`, `for`), `break`, and `continue`.  
Simple programs covering control structures.

### Module 3: Arrays and Strings

Declaration and initialization of arrays – 1D and 2D arrays.  
String processing – built-in functions: `strlen()`, `strcpy()`, `strcat()`, `strcmp()`, `puts()`, `gets()`.  
Programs for linear search and bubble sort.  
Simple programs using arrays and strings.

### Module 4: Working with Functions

Introduction to modular programming.  
Function definition, formal and actual parameters.  
Pass-by-value, recursion, arrays as function parameters.  
Structures and unions.  
Storage classes; scope and lifetime of variables.  
Simple programs using functions and structures.

### Module 5: Pointers and Files

Basics of pointers – declaration, dereferencing, `NULL` pointer.  
Array access using pointers.  
Effect of pass-by-reference using pointers.  
File operations – open, close, read, write, append.  
Sequential and random file access – built-in functions: `rewind()`, `fseek()`, `ftell()`, `feof()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()`.  
Simple programs using pointers and file handling.
